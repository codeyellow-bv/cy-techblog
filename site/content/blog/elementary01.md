Almost all of the desktops and laptops at Code Yellow are running Elementary OS and today Beta 2 of this operating 
system has been released. Some of our machines are running daily updates so in a sense they already were up to date
to the latest version. Read more about the new beta on the [Elementary home](http://elementaryos.org).
