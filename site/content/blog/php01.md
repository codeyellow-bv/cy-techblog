Today the kind people at [FuelPHP released a new version](http://fuelphp.com/blogs/2013/05/fuelphp-releases-v1-6) 
of their framework, promising some big changes and improvements. The official introduction of Composer is perhaps
the most noteworthy of the changes. 

Composer has been the main reason to choose for FuelPHP as the core framework of our web applications, since it 
gives us the ease of combining our own packages into the stable FuelPHP framework. Keep an eye on our blog for
a more detailed overview of the amazing features of composer.
