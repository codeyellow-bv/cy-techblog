At Code Yellow we use the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) for quick prototyping. The Debian based Raspbian
image, available at the [Raspberry Pi Download section](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads) is easy to use and 
little extra knowledge of Linux is required. 

The device is mainly used to build fully working prototypes with other hardware, in order to simulate and test
the concept of embedded hardware which interacts with our web applications. USB support is excellent and with the 
power of Python we are able to develop quickly some concepts. 

Below is a picture of a nice little setup with an Epson POS printer. The Pi facilitates the connection between the 
printer and our webshop. Orders placed in the shop are immediately available for the retailer if he puts this set-up
into his shop.
